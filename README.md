## Install

To build, install [opam](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/) and OCaml 4.01 and run:

    $ ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind grench.native
    $ ln -s $PWD/grench.native ~/bin/grench # or somewhere on your $PATH

## Usage

You can use `grench` as a replacement launcher for `lein` for most
non-interactive tasks. When used together with `:eval-in :nrepl`, you
can eval Clojure code inside your project in under 0.15 seconds.

Currently requires Leiningen from git master (newer than 2.3.2). It's
up to you to launch your own Leiningen process separately:

    $ cd ~/.lein && lein repl :headless

Tasks for all projects will share the same Leiningen instance, so
projects with have conflicting plugins may behave unpredictably.
