## Install

You would need to install [opam](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/) and OCaml 4.x to be
able to build Grenchman.

If you're not sure whether you have 4.x installed or not, you can ensure
yourself as follows:

    $ opam switch list
    # If your system compiler is 4.x or above, you're ready to go.
    # Otherwise, issue the following command:
    $ opam switch 4.00.1

To build, run the following commands:

    $ git clone git@github.com:technomancy/grenchman.git grenchman
    $ cd grenchman
    $ opam install core async ocamlfind
    $ ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind grench.native
    $ ln -s $PWD/grench.native ~/bin/grench # or somewhere on your $PATH

## Usage

You can use `grench` as a replacement launcher for `lein` for most
tasks, though the `repl` task is not yet supported.

Currently it requires Leiningen from git master (newer than 2.3.2). It's
up to you to launch your own Leiningen process separately:

    $ cd ~/.lein && lein repl :headless

You may find this snippet useful to put in your user profile:

```clj
:aliases {"eval" ["run" "-m" "clojure.main/main" "-e"]}
```

This lets you eval one expression at a time.

Tasks for all projects will share the same Leiningen instance, so
projects with have conflicting plugins or hooks may behave unpredictably.

## Faster

Using Grenchman means you never have to wait for Leiningen's JVM to
start, but project JVMs are still launched like normal by default for
most task invocations. In order to avoid that, you can run `lein repl`
(with or without `:headless`) inside the project directory and
`grench` will automatically route `eval-in-project` calls to that
running repl instance.

Then you can run things like:

    $ time grench eval '(:status (my.web/app {:uri "/"}))'
    200

    real    0m0.651s
    user    0m0.024s
    sys     0m0.024s
